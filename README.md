# Energy Management System

## Project Name:
Energy Management System (Exception Handling and Unit Testing)

## Description:
This project simulates an Energy Management System designed to manage log files for charging stations and energy sources. The system allows users to create daily logs, view logs, simulate data exchange, and manage log files (create, delete, move). It is designed to monitor and control the energy usage of charging stations in an organized and efficient manner.

In this version, we have integrated advanced exception handling and comprehensive unit testing as per the project requirements. Each team member contributed to implementing specific exception handling mechanisms and corresponding unit tests, ensuring robust error management and high-quality code.

### Project Requirements:
1. **Create Metadata for Managing Log Files**:
   - Implemented in the **LogFileManager** class with methods like `createLogFile`, `deleteLogFile`, and `moveLogFile` to handle log files systematically.

2. **Simulate Data Exchange Using Streams**:
   - Implemented in the **DataExchangeSimulation** class, utilizing byte streams to simulate data exchanges between energy stations and the system.

3. **Generate Logs for Each Day for Charging Stations and Energy Sources**:
   - Implemented in the **DailyLogCreator** class, with methods like `createDailyLog` and `createSystemLogs`, ensuring logs are consistently formatted.

4. **Allow Users to Open Log Files by Equipment Name or Date**:
   - Implemented in the **LogViewer** class with the `openLogFile` method, allowing users to view specific log files based on equipment name or date.

5. **Exception Handling**:
   - Integrated multiple exception handling strategies into the system to ensure robust error management:
     - **Handling Multiple Exceptions**: Implemented in `MultipleExceptionsHandler` to manage multiple types of exceptions within a single block.
     - **Re-throwing Exceptions**: Implemented in `RethrowExceptionHandler`, which catches and re-throws exceptions to propagate errors for higher-level handling.
     - **Chaining Exceptions**: Implemented in `ChainingExceptionHandler`, which preserves the original exception while adding new context to the error.
     - **Resource Management**: Implemented in `ResourceManagementHandler` to ensure resources, like file streams, are properly managed and closed, even when exceptions occur.

6. **Unit Testing**:
   - We developed unit tests for each exception handling class, covering edge cases and main functionality to ensure proper behavior in all scenarios.
   - All tests are organized into a test suite (`AllTests.java`), allowing for easy execution and verification of the system's correctness.
